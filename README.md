The “Stock Management System” project serves the purpose of having an automated system which has been developed to automate the stock processes 
with the intent to ease the operation and reduce manual effort resulting in better management of stock. Each product will be recognized by its 
product id, product name, quantity available and the category they belong to. Stock Management refers to the process of supervising and controlling 
the stock items of a company. Typically, Stock Management Systems are used by firms that either sell a product or manufacture a product for the 
purpose of accounting all the tangible goods that allow for a sale of a finished product, or parts for making a product. This stock management system
consists of Product Management to add, list and update the stock based on the sale details, Purchase Management, Sales Management to generate receipts 
for sales and User management to keep records of the customers.
